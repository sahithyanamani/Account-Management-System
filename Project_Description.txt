----->ACCOUNT

The program defines an abstract base class Account with two derived classes: StockAccount and BankAccount.
Inheritance Structure: abstract base class Account has two derived classes: StockAccount and BankAccount.
Cash Balance Connection: Connect StockAccount and BankAccount information through a shared cash balance.


----->Stock Portfolio Account

- Data Handling: Manage stock portfolios using information from 'Results.txt' files.
- Persistence: Store account information in text files to retain data between program sessions.
- Doubly Linked List: Use a custom implementation of a doubly linked list to store and manage stock information.
- Sorting Requirement: Maintain the doubly linked list sorted by the total value of stocks owned.
- Transaction Handling: Implement functionalities to buy and sell shares, updating portfolio and cash balance accordingly.
- Record Keeping: Store transaction details in text files for later reference.
  
 ----->Bank Account

- Initial Balance: Bank account starts with an initial balance of $10,000.
- Transaction Recording: Record deposit and withdrawal activities in the bank account transaction history.
- Options Available: View account balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and print transaction history.

 ----->Functionality Highlights

1. Stock Operations:
   - Display stock price, current portfolio, buy and sell shares, view portfolio value graph, and transaction history.
2. Bank Operations:
   - View account balance, deposit, withdraw, and view transaction history.

 ----->Design Patterns used

 1. Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that facilitates the creation
 of an algorithm's outline in a base class while enabling subclasses to redefine specific steps without
  altering the overall structure of the algorithm. This pattern promotes reusability and consistency across 
  similar algorithms.

2. Stratergy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern is indeed a behavioral design pattern that allows defining a family of algorithms, 
encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. 
It enables the client to choose the algorithm at runtime without altering the object that uses it.

----->Warnings
I'm encountering a warning after executing the plot graph, but it's safe to disregard. The warning message
 mentions the CodeCache being full and the compiler being disabled. This seems to be specific to the Matlab 
 application on Mac with the Apple chip. Unfortunately, it appears there's no available fix for this issue.
 
 "Option: CodeCache is full. Compiler has been disabled.
Try increasing the code cache size using -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize="

----->Sorting Algorithms used
1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Insertion sort
